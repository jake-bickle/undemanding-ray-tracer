# Undemanding Ray Tracer

A simple graphics renderer via ray tracing. Much of what I learned can be credited to [scratchapixel.com](https://www.scratchapixel.com/).
If you have any interest in rendering graphics, they have great tutorials for different methods of doing so.
While they provide great lessons, their provided code is severely lacking in organization for the sake of brevity. 
This project provides a much better structure to the code which allows for greater scalability, maintainability, and most importantly understanding.

Take a look at the screenshots folder to see the current status of the ray tracer!

Right now, the ray tracer is quite limited. Some upcoming changes include
- Camera translation and rotation
- Object reflectance
- Object transparency (with light refraction)
- More 3D shapes (such as cubes and planes)
